A simple addon that notifies you of pending calendar event invites, guild event sign ups player created events.
It will also provide a more noticeable 15 min. warning alarm for events that are beginning soon.

The alarm is repeated every 3 min. until the start of the event. CalEventNotifier collects all events for the
current day of all your characters. So that you can relog in time to the character who wants to participate at the event.

To collect all events it's necessary that for the current day all your characters once were logged in.

If during the time in which you are with your character online, an event is deleted or changed the start time,
an appropriate message is displayed. Once you are in a combat, dialog boxes are now cached and only 1 minute after
which you no longer engaged in combat, appears.
